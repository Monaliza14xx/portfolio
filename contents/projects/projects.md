## Lao OCR
The Lao OCR project is a tool developed by students at the National University of Laos. It converts scanned Laotian text in images into digital text using optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Users can upload images to extract and work with Laotian text easily. The project aims to enhance accessibility and digitization of Laotian language resources.
